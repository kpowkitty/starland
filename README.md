# Starland: a Wayland Adventure
My attempt(s) at learning how to build a personalized Wayland compositor. I am interested in creating a windows manager similar to Hyprland, as such, this is documentation of my advance in that direction.

## Attempt 1: Following [Drew DeVault's blog]([url](https://drewdevault.com/2018/02/17/Writing-a-Wayland-compositor-1.html)) 

- All code is from his blog
- Comments are either my own or copied from his blog
- Purely used as a learning experience

### Status: Unfinished
- DeVault's tutorial relies heavily on wlroots. As of October 23, 2020, DeVault gave up maintenance of wlroots to another programmer. Since this hand-off, wlroots has gone through many refactorings. As such, the tutorial came to a halt due to outdated information and incompatible code.
- There is a possibility to readdress this in the future, but when I have more understanding of Wayland. In order to move forward, I will be switching to another tutorial written by [Philippe Gaultier](https://gaultier.github.io/blog/wayland_from_scratch.html).
